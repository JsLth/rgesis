GESIS Search is a service by GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences to look up information about research data, survey variables, empirical instruments and tools, literature, and library collections from the social sciences. `rgesis` is a package to query its search engine to retrieve metadata on search records and to download survey data from GESIS' comprehensive data archive. It does so in a reproducible manner that can easily be embedded in code files and publications. The package mainly consists of three functions

1. Authenticate a session using `gesis_auth()`
2. Search the GESIS catalogue using `gesis_search()`
3. Retrieve data using `gesis_data()`

# Authentication

GESIS expects all users who wish to download a data file to be logged in. The `gesis_auth()` function takes over this task purely programmatically. You need to provide the function with a user email and a password. This can be done either by passing them as function arguments or by setting them as global options. It is recommended to do the latter using a `.Rprofile` file. This can look something like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(
  gesis_email = "jonas.lieth@gesis.org",
  gesis_password = "****",
  gesis_download_purpose = "non_scientific"
)
```

Here, I also specified a download purpose which must be specified to download data. If you know that this purpose is not going to change between queries, you can specify it globally.

When the credentials are set, you can run `gesis_auth()` without arguments. This step 1. sends a login request, 2. checks if you can login, and 3. stores the credentials in a secure [keyring](https://keyring.r-lib.org/) storage. If you get a success message, you are good to go.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gesis_auth()
# âœ” Successfully performed GESIS login.
```


# GESIS Search

Even without authentication, you can use `rgesis` to retrieve metadata on GESIS search entries like datasets, variables, publications or tools. This can be done using the `gesis_search()` function which offers tools for querying and filtering the GESIS search engine. For example, to get metadata on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) from 2018, you can do:

```{r search-allbus}
gesis_search(
  "allbus",
  type = "research_data",
  collection_year = c(2018, 2018)
)
```

`"allbus"` is the query string, `"research_data"` is the result type (you can also search for other types like publications or tools), and `c(2018, 2018)` is the time in which the queried dataset must be collected.

If you need this data in a more workable manner, you can set `tidy = TRUE`. This will convert the metadata to a pretty dataframe. Be aware that not all metadata fields can be fit in a rectangular shape and must be dropped. If completeness of metadata records is a priority, you should leave the output untidy.

```{r search-allbus-tidy}
gesis_search(
  "allbus",
  type = "research_data",
  collection_year = c(2018, 2018),
  tidy = TRUE
)
```

While the first 10 results are enough for many use cases, sometimes you just need more than that. By default, `gesis_search()` only requests the first search page. You can choose which pages to request by setting the `pages` argument. You can even request all pages by setting it to `NULL`.

```{r search-allbus-pages}
gesis_search(
  "allbus",
  type = "research_data",
  collection_year = c(2018, 2018),
  tidy = TRUE,
  pages = NULL
)
```

To exemplify, we can perform a very basic bibliographic analysis of the evolution of climate change literature based on the most relevant 5000 records in the GESIS archive.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cc <- gesis_search(
  "climate change",
  type = "publication",
  pages = 1:500,
  tidy = TRUE
)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(na.omit(cc[c("date", "subtype")])) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = date, fill = subtype)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Type", labels = c(
    book = "Book",
    in_proceedings = "Proceedings",
    journal_article = "Article"
  )) +
  guides(x = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Count") +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/gesis-data_plot1.png", dpi = 400)
```

Finally, if you already know a dataset or record you want to look up, you can use the `gesis_get()` function to search for a specific record ID. These IDs can be retrieved from the metadata records returned by `gesis_search()`. 

```{r gesis_get}
allbus <- gesis_get("ZA5272")
allbus
```


# Data retrieval

Both of the last two steps ultimately help to retrieve survey data from the GESIS data archive. First, authentication is needed to be allowed to download in the first place. Second, a metadata record (or at least a record ID) is needed to specify what dataset you want to download. Finally, it is often a good idea to first explore what kinds of data are in store for a given record. The `gesis_file_types()` function gives insights into the types of data available.

```{r}
gesis_file_types(allbus)
```

Now we know that the ALLBUS record contains dataset files. But which files are available exactly?

```{r}
gesis_files(allbus, type = "dataset")
```

Using this information, we can download the .sav file to disk using the `gesis_data()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- gesis_data(allbus, select = "\\.sav")
```

Since GESIS files can come in all kinds of file formats, the package leaves reading the data to the user. In this case, we can use the [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package to read the downloaded file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(haven)
allbus_data <- read_sav(path)

allbus_data <- allbus_data |>
  select(eastwest, economic_situation = ep01, samesex_marriage = pa12) |>
  mutate(across(everything(), .fns = ~as_factor(.x))) |>
  mutate(eastwest = str_to_title(eastwest)) |>
  select(economic_situation, samesex_marriage, eastwest) |>
  na.omit()

ggplot(allbus_data, aes(economic_situation)) +
  geom_bar(
    aes(fill = samesex_marriage),
    position = position_fill(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~eastwest) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(
    name = "Same-sex marriages\nshould be illegal",
    labels = str_to_title,
    direction = -1
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = str_to_title) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Economic situation", y = "Share") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/gesis-data_plot2.png", dpi = 400)
```
